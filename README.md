I am Shruti Chatterjee, 1st year student of Masters in Economics from Ashoka university. Currently I have just completed one externship with paragon one regarding VC industry market research and data analysis and now I am in an ongoing internship at AQES as a secondary market research intern.I have a fundamental knowledge in python and  eagerly waiting for this course as AI is an interest for me.
